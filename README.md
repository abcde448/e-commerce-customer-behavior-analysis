E-Commerce Customer Behavior Analysis
A comprehensive Data visualization and Storytelling project that uncovers valuable business insights by analyzing customer behavior, purchase patterns, and satisfaction levels in an e-commerce platform â€” all through the power of Python and visualization.

Project Objective
To explore a real-world customer dataset and identify:
What factors influence return customers?
How does customer satisfaction vary?
What are the top-performing products, payment preferences, and more?

All insights are communicated visually â€” using clean, professional plots built with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Age, Gender, Location
Purchase Amount ($), Review Score (1-5)
Subscription Status, Return Customer
Payment Method, Discount Availed

Tools & Technologies Used
Python 
   Numpy
   Pandas

4) Which locations have the highest spending customers?
5) What influences return customers?
6) Is there a link between time on site and spending?
7) How do review scores impact return behavior? and more...

Visual Insights
Each analysis is visualized with clean, story-driven plots:
-- Bar charts for purchase & product trends
-- Regression plots to find relationships
-- Pie charts for share of device usage
-- Box plots for satisfaction & delivery analysis

Location-based comparisons with highlight plots
- All charts follow a consistent, elegant theme â€” using whitegrid & dark styles for maximum clarity and engagement.

Final Deliverables
The following outputs are included:

- Clean Notebook (.ipynb)
- 16+ Professionally styled .png plots
- PowerPoint Report (.pptx)
- Ready for LinkedIn showcase, portfolio upload, or client demo!
